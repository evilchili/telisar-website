Welcome, Dear Reader! This site is a compendium of information about a Dungeons and Dragons 5th
Edition campaign I am running for a few of my friends. Most of us are first-timers to TTRPGs, and
while we are approaching the end of our second year of the campaign we're still learning a ton.

You can explore the session summaries and lore in the links above; below, you'll find some campaign
metadata that may be of intrest...

<li> <a href='{{< ref "welcome_to_telisar" >}}'>Welcome to Telisar</a> is the introductory text I
sent to the players before our first session</li>
<li> <a href='{{< ref "timeline" >}}'>The Timeline</a> is a brief summary of critical events thus
far</li>
<li> <a href='{{< ref "inns_and_taverns" >}}'>A list of Inns and Taverns</a></li>
<li> <a href='{{< ref "dramatis_personae" >}}'>A list of NPCs</a></li>
