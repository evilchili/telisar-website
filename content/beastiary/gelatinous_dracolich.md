      **Legendary Resistance (3/day)** If the dracolich fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

      ## Actions

      **Multiattack** The dracolich can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three pseudopod attacks.

      **Unnatural Cold** All creatures that start their turn within 10ft of the dracolich takes 6 (2d10) cold damage.

      **Pseudopod** *Melee Weapon Attack* +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (1d6+7) bludgeoning damage and 1d10 cold damage.

      **Frightful Presence** Each creature of the dracolich's choice that is within 120 feet of the dracolich and aware of it must succeed on a DC 17 WIS saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dracolich's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

      **Engulfing Breath (recharge 5-6)** The dracolich exhales gelatinous ice in a 60 ft cone. Each creature in the cone must succeed on a DC 19 DEX saving throw or take 6d6 cold damage and become engulfed. Creatures who succeed the saving throw take 3d6 cold damage and are not engulfed. Engulfed creatures are frozen in place: they are restrained and they take 3d6 cold damage at the start of their turn. An engulfed creature can spend an action to make a STR 17 saving throw to break free.

      ## Legendary Actions

      The dracolich can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The dracolich can move up to 40ft during its legendary action.

      The dracolich regains its spent legendary actions at the start of its next turn.

      **Pseudopod Attack** The dracolich makes a pseudopod attack.

      **Wing Attack (costs 2 actions)** The dracolich beats its wings. Each creature within 10 feet of the dracolich must succeed on a DC 21 DEX saving throw or take 14 (2d6+7) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. After beating its wings this way, the dracolich can fly up to half its flying speed.

      **Meld Into Ice (costs 2 actions)** The dracolich can submerge itself in a volume of gelatinous ice no smaller than a 20ft radius sphere. It can then swim up to half its swimming speed. While submerged, the dracolich has full cover and advantage on stealth checks.

For time uncounting the great peak darkened the Feywild skies not with ash but unending blizzards of snow and sleet. The mountain slope flowed with rivers of frigid gelatinous ice in a bizarre geology obeying rules no mortal has ever delved. Mab collapsed the peak into a caldera, trapping the ice beneath a thousand thousand tonnes of rock and thereupon constructed her Palace of Ice, naming the seat of her power the Heart of Winter.

With the violent eruptions sealed away, slow-moving rivers of ice cut a maze of twisting arteries through the Heart. More than once forces of Summer have sought to steal into this labyrinth from the outside and make the perilous climb into the Palace of Ice unseen, but none have succeeded. For it is said that even should one survive the unnatural cold, avoid the fearsome creatures that dwell therein, and climb to the very summit, one must contend with the Wellspring, a great cavern and the source of the gelatinous ice at the centre of the mountain. It is there where rests the corpse of a dragon, its bones picked clean by the living ice. But though it died long ago, the evil wyrm's   stubborn consciousness refused to yield, instead twisting and corrupting the ice into a parody of its draconic form. The gelatinous dracolich lies now in eternal sleep at the foot of Mab's palace amongst the Wellspring's great pools of liquid ice, and woe be unto any Knight of Summer who would seek to face it.
