      **Master of War** An ally riding the Nashtal gains advantage on melee attacks against creatures within 5 feet of the Nashtal.

      ## Actions

      **Multiattack** The Nashtahl makes three slam attacks. One slam attack may be replaced with a blood lash.

      **Slam** *Melee* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (1d10 + 4) bludgeoning damage. On a hit the target must make a DC 17 STR saving throw. On a failure the target is knocked prone. If the target is already prone, it is grappled. Targets can use their action to repeat the saving throw.

      **Blood Lash** *Melee* +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 7  (2d6) piercing damage. On a hit a large or smaller target must make a DC 15 DEX saving throw with disadvantage. On a failure the target is grappled and pulled up to 10ft towards the Nashtahl. Grappled targets can repeat the saving throw at the start of their next turn. A target grappled by Blood Lash at the start of their turn has their maximum HP reduced by 10 (3d6) due to blood loss. Targets can use their action to break the grapple by succeeding on a DC 17 STR saving throw.

      While grappling a large- or medium-sized target using blood lash, the Nashtahl's speed is halved.

      ## Bonus Actions

      **Tail Stinger** *Melee* +10 to hit, reach 5ft., one target. Hit: 2d6 piercing damage plus 1d6 poison damage. On a hit the target must succeed on a DC 13 CON saving throw or become poisoned. While poisoned in this way the target is paralyzed.

      ## Legendary Actions

      The Nashtahl can make two legendary actions per round.

      **Unnatural Movement** The Nashtahl can move up to half its normal movement.

      **Slam** The Nashtahl makes one slam attack.

      **Aura of Dread** (Costs two legendary actions) All creatures that can see the Nashtahl must succeed on a DC 15 WIS saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the start of its next turn. A creature which succeeds on the saving throw cannot be frightened again by a Nashtahl for 24 hours.

      ## Reactions

      **Quick Strike** The Nashtahl may make an opportunity attack using either *Tail Stinger* or *Blood Lash*.

A fiend of nightmares native to the Abyss, the Nashtahl resembles a huge war destrier, 6 feet at the shoulder, but its musculature is twisted and unnatural with too many joints. Its powerful limbs end in splayed feet with segmented digits of bone which allow it to move swiftly across the battlefield and also climb large trees, walls, and rock with terrifying accumen. It's green-black hide is patched with thick scales about its head and upon its flanks and haunches. A segmented, ball-spiked tail curls behind it with deadly poisonous stingers. Most alarming of all, the Nashtal's skull is long, wide, and flat, more like a crocodile than a horse, and its entire snout splits into four, peeling open like a flower of flesh and teeth to reveal two long, thin tongues that lash out to snare prey, drag them into its mouth and drink their blood.
