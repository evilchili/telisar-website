  description: |
      **Class 5 Full Roaming Vapor** Slimer is unaffected by difficult terrain, and spells and other magical effects can neither reduce Slimer's speed nor cause Slimer to be paralyzed. Slimer can move through material objects and creatures. If Slimer ends his turn inside an object large enough to contain him, he cannot be targeted until the object is destroyed. Slimer cannot end his movement inside a living creature, and will be moved to the nearest space not containing a creature. Finally, Slimer is not affected by water in either movement or attacks.

      **Foodie** If Slimer can see food within 30 ft, he must succeed on a DC 13 WIS saving throw or spend his whole turn moving towards the food and eating it. Slimer can consume 5lbs of food in 6 seconds. The effect ends when all visible food has been consumed or he takes damage. Once the effect ends, Slimer will ignore food for 1 minute.

      ## Actions

      **Slime** *Melee Attack* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (2d6 + 3) Force damage. On a hit the target is covered in a thick, sticky green slime and has disadvantage on attacks and ability checks until it spends an action cleaning it off. Target must succeed on a DC 13 STR saving throw or be knocked prone.

      ## Legendary Actions

      Slimer gets 1 legendary action per round.

      **Charge** Unless restrained or distracted by food, Slimer can fly up to 30 ft in a straight line and perform a Slime attack against all  creatures in the line it can see. Slimer cannot be targeted by opportunity attacks while charging.

      ## Legendary Reactions

      **Hide** When Slimer takes damage he can move up to 30ft in any direction and stop inside an inanimate object large enough to contain him. Slimer cannot use the Hide reaction while restrained.

A focused, non-terminal repeating phantasm, Slimer is the green, partially-translucent ghost of King Remils the Gluttonous. The dwarfs of Thorimfel say that Remils so loved food that he ate himself to death at his own coronation banquet, and was doomed to haunt his own castle grounds, hungry for all eternity.

Slimer would rather flee than fight, but when provoked will charge adversaries, knocking them from their feet and covering them in a sticky, viscous slime.
