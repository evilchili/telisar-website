      **Icy Ooze** The cube is an ooze of liquid ice. Any creature within 5ft of the ooze takes 5 (1d10) cold damage per round.

      **Ooze Cube** The cube takes up its entire space. Other creatures can enter the space, but a creature that does so is subjected to the cube's Engulf and has disadvantage on the saving throw.

      Creatures inside the cube can be seen but have total cover.

      If the cube has not solidified, a creature within 5 feet of the cube can take an action to pull a creature or object out of the cube. Doing so requires a successful DC 20 Strength check and the creature making the attempt takes 10 (3d6) cold damage. If the cube's HP is reduced to half or less of its maximum HP, the DC is reduced to 15.

      The cube can hold only one Large creature or up to four Medium or smaller creatures inside it at a time.

      **Transparent** Even when the cube is in plain sight, it takes a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check to spot a cube that has neither moved nor attacked. A creature that tries to enter the cube's space while unaware of the cube is surprised by the cube.

      **Slippery** If the cube is on an icey surface, its speed is doubled.

      ## Actions

      **Multiattack** The Gelatinous Ice makes two Pseudopod attacks per round, or one Engulf.

      **Pseudopod** *melee attack* +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (3d6) Bludgeoning damage + 5 (1d10) Cold damage.

      **Engulf** The cube moves up to its speed. While doing so, it can enter Large or smaller creatures' spaces. Whenever the cube enters a creature's space, the target creature must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw.

      On a success, the creature may choose to be pushed 5 feet back or to the side of the cube. A creature that chooses not to be pushed suffers the consequences of a failed saving throw.

      On a failed save, the cube enters the creature's space, the creature takes 10 (3d6) cold damage, and is engulfed. The engulfed creature can't breathe, is restrained, and takes 21 (6d6) cold damage at the start of each of the cube's turns. When the cube moves, the engulfed creature moves with it.

      An engulfed creature can try to escape by taking an action to make a DC 20 Strength check. On a success, the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the cube. If the cube's HP is reduced to half or less of its maximum HP, the DC of the strength check is reduced to 15.

      ## Legendary Actions

      The Gelatinous Ice gets one Legendary Action per round.

      **Solidify** The cube solidifies, turning to solid ice. While solid, its speed is zero and its AC is 20. A creature or object engulfed by a solid cube cannot be pulled out from the outside and is incapacitated.

      The cube can choose to end the Solidify effect as a bonus action.

      While solid, for each 25 points of damage it receives of a type other than fire or acid, a portion of the cube reverts to its gelatinous form, breaks free, and becomes an Icy Ooze.

      ## Lair and Lair Actions

      If an open source of oozing ice is present, on initiative count 20 1d4 Icy Oozes emerge.

A Gelatinous Ice Cube is solid ice transformed into a thick, viscous liquid by the raw arcane nature of the Feywild. 

Huge colonies of Icy Oozes -- and their larger, more terrifying counterparts, the Gelatinous Ice Cubes -- can be found far to wintershins in the Feywild, moving through the deep recesses of the Shatterspine Mountains. Those few adventurers both foolhardy enough to encounter them and lucky enough to survive describe mountains that look like volcanos, erupting with a slow-moving, freezing magma.

**Ooze Nature** An ooze doesnâ€™t require sleep.
