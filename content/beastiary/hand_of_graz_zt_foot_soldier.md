  description: |
      **Screams of the Damned** A creature attuned to the Greatsword of Soul Drinking will have their maximum hit points reduced by 1 every hour until they unattune or the weapon is destroyed. If the creature's maximum HP is reduced to zero, its soul is absorbed into the sword.

      **Infernal Smite** The Greatsword of Soul Drinking has three charges. When the foot soldier hits a target with an attack using this weapon, before the damage roll the soldier may expend 1 charge to deal 10 points of fire damage to the target in addition to the weapon's normal damage.

      **Drinker of Souls** Whenever the foot soldier kills a humanoid other than a construct or undead with this magical sword, the humanoid's soul is absorbed into it and the soldier gains 10 temporary hit points. A humanoid whose soul resides within the sword cannot be resurrected by any means except by a Wish spell. Souls can only be released by melting down the sword blade in fire such as a forge, volcano, etc. Souls within the sword cannot communicate, but an Identify spell targeting the sword will reveal the names of every Soul currently trapped within.

      ## Actions

      The Foot Soldier makes two weapon attacks, or one weapon attack and one tail attack.

      **Soul Drinker Greatsword** *melee* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 2d6 (5) slashing damage.

      **Tail Attack** *melee* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 3d8 (13) piercing damage. On a hit the target must succeed on a DC 16 CON save or take 1d8 poison damage and be incapacitated until the end of its next turn.

      ## Reactions

      *Opportunity Attack* when making an opportunity attack, the foot soldier may use its tail attack instead of a weapon attack.

Hulking abyssal soldiers with purple-black skin, patches of green scales, and a thin, segmented tail ending in three prongs glistening in oil. The face has no nose, no mouth, and is dominated by huge, jaundiced eyes.
