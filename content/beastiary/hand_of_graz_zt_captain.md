      **Screams of the Damned** A creature attuned to the Greatsword of Soul Drinking will have their maximum hit points reduced by 1 every hour until they unattune or the weapon is destroyed. If the creature's maximum HP is reduced to zero, its soul is absorbed into the sword.

      **Infernal Smite** The Greatsword of Soul Drinking has three charges. When the captain hits a target with an attack using this weapon, before the damage roll the captain may expend 1 charge to deal 10 points of fire damage to the target in addition to the weapon's normal damage.

      **Drinker of Souls** Whenever the captain kills a humanoid other than a construct or undead with this magical sword, the humanoid's soul is absorbed into it and the captain gains 10 temporary hit points. A humanoid whose soul resides within the sword cannot be resurrected by any means except by a Wish spell. Souls can only be released by melting down the sword blade in fire such as a forge, volcano, etc. Souls within the sword cannot communicate, but an Identify spell targeting the sword will reveal the names of every Soul currently trapped within.

      ## Actions

      The Captain makes two weapon attacks, or one weapon attack and one tail attack.

      **Soul Drinker Greatsword** *melee* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 2d6 (5) slashing damage.

      **Tail Attack** *melee* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 3d8 (13) piercing damage. On a hit the target must succeed on a DC 16 CON save or take 1d8 poison damage and be incapacitated until the end of its next turn.

      ## Reactions

      **Tail Attack** when making an opportunity attack, the captain may use its tail attack instead of a weapon attack.
    
      **You Die When I Say You Do** When up to 3 allies are reduced to 0 HP, the Captain may use its reaction to force them to remain conscious with 1 HP instead. 

      ## Legendary Actions

      **Get Over Here** Once per round, the Captain may move up to 3 allies 15ft closer to him in a straight line.
