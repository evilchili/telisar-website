  description: |

    **Keeper of Balance** The Sentinel In Darkness is the protector of the
    Wanderer's Temple. If an offering is removed from one of the offering
    boxes, one of the sentinel's four hands closes into a fist and it gains an
    additional multiattack. If an offering is added to an offering box of
    equal or greater value to that which was removed, one of the sentinel's
    closed fists opens, and its multiattack is reduced by 1. If offerings are
    given which equal or exceed the value of all offerings removed from the
    boxes, the Sentinel in Darkness's hands all open, it stops attacking, and
    returns to the pedestal.

    **Everlasting Aide** The Sentinel in Darkness's physical form cannot be destroyed. If its HP is reduced to 0, the stone construct shatters, but the debris will return to the statue's pedestal and reform. After 1 minute, the statue is fully reformed and regains its max HP.

      ## Actions

      **Multiattack** The sentinel makes one stone fist attack for each hand that is currently closed into a fist.

      **Stone Fist** *Melee Weaopn Attack* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (2d12 + 5) bludgeoning damage.

      **Forced Offering** At the end of the sentinel's turn, any target the sentinel damaged with Stone Fist this turn must roll a d6. On a 1 or a 2, the target's equipped weapon is magically teleported to an offering box. If the creature does not have a weapon equipped, a random magical item in the creature's inventory selected by the DM is taken. If the target has no magical items in its inventory, 10d10 gold pieces or equivalent currency from its inventory is taken. If the target has no currency, nothing is taken.

      ## Legendary Actions

      The Sentinel in Darkness can make three Legendary Actions per round, only one of which can be Curse of the Wanderer.

      **Curse of the Wanderer** One creature the sentinel can see within 30 feet must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or suffer the Curse of the Wanderer. While cursed, the creature's speed is halved and it can't regain HP. For every 24 hours it goes without discovering or learning new information, it takes 10 (3d6) psychic damage. The curse lasts until it is lifted by a remove curse spell or similar magic.

      **Sentinel's Rebuke** If the sentinel has taken damage this round, it can use Forced Offering, targeting a creature that damaged it. Forced Offering can only be used against the same target once per reaction.

Deep in the hidden parts of the world, the Dragonborn built sanctified temples designed to provide aid and succor to those who came after them. Three offerings are made available to those who enter a Wanderer's Temple, guarded by the Sentinel in Darkness: a stone construct in the form of a 10ft tall, four-armed, blindfolded Dragonborn. To leave the temple in peace, an additional offering must be added to one of the three stone offering boxes. If offerings are removed from the temple, an offering of equal or greater value must be left behind. The Sentinel in Darkness will attack anyone who attempts to leave the Wanderer's Temple without balancing the offerings.

If a creature spends a short rest or long rest in the safety of the Wanderer's
Temple, the temple is sealed and a new offering must be made before the way is
opened.

**Making an Offering** The value of an offering is determined by its utility to a Dragonborn adventurer from millenia ago, and roughly ranked by item rarity. A common item can generally be swapped for any other common item; two common items might be swapped for an uncommon item, four uncommon items might be swapped for a rare item, and so on, at the DM's discretion. Raw currency can be offered to match the value of an item. Knowledge may also be offered, in the form of books, scrolls and parchments. The value of the knowledge will be adjudicated by the DM.
