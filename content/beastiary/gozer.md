      **Legendary Resistance (3/Day)** If the Giant Sloar fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

      **Fire Absorption** Whenever the Giant Sloar is subjected to fire damage, it takes no damage and instead regains a number of hit points equal to the fire damage dealt.

      **Immutable Form** The Giant Sloar is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form. Gozer is whatever it wants to be.

      **Magic Resistance** The Giant Sloar has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

      ## Actions

      **Multiattack** The Giant Sloar makes three melee attacks.

      **Tail** *Melee Weapon Attack* +19 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: (4d6 + 10) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

      **Bite** Melee Weapon Attack: +19 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: (4d12 + 10) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it is grappled (escape DC 20). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the Giant Sloar can't bite another target.

      **Swallow** The Giant Sloar makes one bite attack against a Large or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target takes the bite's damage, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the Giant Sloar. It takes 56 (16d6) fire damage at the start of each of the Giant Sloar's turns. If the Giant Sloar takes 60 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the Giant Sloar must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the Giant Sloar. If the Giant Sloar dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 30 feet of movement, exiting prone.

      ## Legendary Actions

      The Giant Sloar can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The Giant Sloar regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

      **Attack** The Giant Sloar makes one tail attack.

      **Move** The Giant Sloar moves up to half its speed.

      **Chomp (Costs 2 Actions)** The Giant Sloar makes one bite attack or uses its Swallow.

> "*Then, during the Third Reconciliation of the Last of the Meketrex Supplicants, they chose a new form for him, that of a giant sloar! Many Shubs and Zulls knew what it was to be roasted in the depths of a sloar that day, I can tell you!*"

The choice has been made! At over 90 feet long and weighing in excess of 100 tonnes, a full-grown giant sloar is one of the most feared Abyssal monstrosities known to exist. The sloar resembles a great eyeless worm or leech; its head is mostly mouth, with row upon row of yellow razor teeth each as long as a man, silhouetted in the red-orange glow of the flames in its belly. The sloar's body is covered in thick  scales the color of iron, but it moves with surprising quickness, and snatching up creatures and swallowing them whole to burn alive as they are  digested, or lashing out with its massive tail.
