      **Amorphous.** The ooze can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.

      **Unnatural Cold** Any creature within 5ft of the ooze takes 5 (1d10) cold damage per round.

      **False Appearance.** While the ooze remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a patch of ice.

      **Slippery** If the cube is on an icy surface, its walking speed is doubled.

      ## Actions

      **Pseudopod** *Melee Weapon Attack* +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d6 + 1) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) cold damage.

      **Leaping Strike** *Ranged Weapon Attack* +3 to hit, range 20 ft., one target. Hit: 2d6 cold damage. On a hit the ooze attaches itself to its target, and deals 2d6 cold damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can spend an action to attempt to remove an attached ooze. To do so, the creature must succeed on an opposed Strength check versus the ooze.

An Icy Ooze is solid ice transformed into a thick, viscous liquid by the raw arcane nature of the Feywild. When it moves, it slithers like a liquid snake, rising to strike.

Huge colonies of Icy Oozes -- and their larger, more terrifying counterparts, the Gelatinous Ice Cubes -- can be found far to wintershins in the Feywild, moving through the deep recesses of the Shatterspine Mountains. Those few adventurers both foolhardy enough to encounter them and lucky enough to survive describe mountains that look like volcanos, erupting with a slow-moving, freezing magma.

**Ooze Nature** An ooze doesnâ€™t require sleep.
