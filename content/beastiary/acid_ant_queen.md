        **Chitinous Armor** The Acid Ant Queen's body is covered in interlocking plates of armor. Every 50 points of damage it suffers causes cracks and breaks in the armor which reduces its AC by 1. Whenever this happens, a spray of acid erupts from the broken plate and all creatures in a 10ft radius must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (2d6 + 3) acid damage, or half damage on a success.

        **Tough To Crack** The Acid Ant Queen is resistant to all bludgeoning, piercing and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons until its AC drops to 14, at which point the damage to its armor removes this resistance.

        ## Actions

        **Multiattack** The Acid Ant Queen makes 2 bite attacks per round. If it successfully grapples a target, it makes a third bite attack.

        **Bite** *Melee Weapon Attack* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) acid damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it is grappled. Until this grapple ends, the Acid Ant Queen can bite only the grappled creature and has advantage on attack rolls to do so. A grappled creature can escape by succeeding on a DC 16 Strength (Athletics) check.

        ## Legendary Actions

        **Summon Ants** The Acid Ant Queen summons 1d4 +1 acid ants.

        **Burrow** If above ground, the Acid Ant Queen burrows into the ground up to 40 feet creating a tunnel 5 feet in diameter. If the Queen is grappling a creature, that creature is now restrained and, if it breathes, suffocating. If the Queen is underground, it can burrow up to 40 feet out of the ground, bursting through the soil. Any creature standing above it in a 10 foot radius must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.

        ## Legendary Reactions

        The Acid Ant Queen has two Legendary Reactions per round. When hit by physical attacks the Queen releases a cloud of pheromones from  its body with one of the following effects:

        1. **Paralyzing Cloud** The Acid Ant Queen releases a cloud of pheromones in a 30 foot radius sphere. Any creature within range must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw against poison or spend its action that turn retching and reeling. Creatures that donâ€™t need to breathe or are immune to poison automatically succeed on this saving throw. Targets in range must repeat the saving throw at the end of their turn or continue to retch for another turn. The effects last until the cloud is dispersed, or the Queen uses a different pheromonal cloud.
        1. **Zombie Cloud** The Acid Ant Queen releases a cloud of pheromones in a 30 foot radius sphere. Any creature within range must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become charmed. Creatures that don't need to breathe or are immune to charm effects automatically succeed on this saving throw. Charmed creatures take only the Actions the Queen chooses, and don't do anything that Queen does not permit. They cannot speak, emitting only guttural moans, and their Intelligence score drops to 5. The effects last until the cloud is dispersed, or the Queen uses a different pheromonal cloud. Charmed creatures may repeat the saving throw whenever they take damage. Creatures who succeed on a saving throw are immune to the effects of the Controlling Cloud for 24 hours.
        1. **Confusing Cloud** The Acid Ant Queen releases a cloud of pheromones in a 30 foot radius sphere. Any creature within range must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become confused, and suffer the effects similar to the confusion spell. Confused creature may repeat the saving throw at the end of their turn. Creatures who succeed on a saving throw are immune to the effects of the Confusing Cloud for 24 hours.
        1. **Frenzy Cloud** The Acid Ant Queen releases a cloud of pheromones in a 30 foot radius sphere. Any Acid Ant within range enters a frenzied rage. Frenzied acid ants have advantage on Strength Checks and Strength Saving Throws, gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls, and gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing and slashing damage.The effects last until the cloud is dispersed, or the Queen uses a different pheromonal cloud.

        A moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses the queen's pheromone clouds after 4 rounds. A strong wind (at least 20 miles per hour) disperses it after 1 round. The Queen's pheromones penetrate soil and earth to a range of 30 feet, but cannot pass through water, fire or dense materials such as wood and stone. If the Queen is encased in a non-penetrating material an existing pheromone cloud dissipates after 1 round.
