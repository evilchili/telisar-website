  description: |

      **I have a plan. I know just what to do** The Librarian will not attack unless provoked by someone making noise or touching books. Anyone talking in the Library above a whisper will be warned once with a "Shhhh!" If the noise continues, the Librarian will attack. The Librarian will attack instantly if anyone makes a loud noise or disturbs any books. If the Librarian initiates combat, it will always use Frightful Presence first.

      ## Actions

      **Multiattack** The Librarian makes two attacks per round.

      **Frightful Presence** Each creature that is within 30 feet of the Librarian and aware of it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the Librarian's  Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

      **Forceful Slam** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 10 (3d6) force damage.

      **Telekinetic Thrust** The Librarian targets a Medium or smaller creature it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target weight 150 pounds or less, the Haunted Library makes a Charisma check contested by the target's Strength check. If the Haunted Library wins the contest, it hurls the target up to 30 feet in any direction, including upward. If the target then comes into contact with a hard surface or heavy object, the target takes 1d6 damage per 10 feet moved.

      ## Legendary Actions

      The Haunted Library takes 2 Legendary Actions per round. It can only use one at a time, and only at the end of another creature's turn.

      **Symmetrical Book Stacking** The Haunted Library creates a stack of 50 books on the ground. No human being would stack books this way.

      **Book Missiles** If a stack of books as created by Symmetrical Book Stacking contains 10 or more books, The Haunted Library can hurl up to 10 books from the stack up to 120 feet, targeting one creature it can see. The target makes a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw and takes (25) 10d4 points of bludgeoning damage on a failure, or half as much on a save.

      ## Legendary Reactions

      **Invisibility** When the Librarian takes damage, it can turn invisible, unless it is restrained by a Confinement Beam.

      ## Lair and Lair Actions

      **Wild Magic Surge** The Haunted Library is a repository of concentrated magical knowledge and arcane energy, and frequent bursts of wild magic create a dangerous, unpredictable environment. When in combat, [roll on this wild magic table]("https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Wild_Magic_Surge_Table,_Variant_(5e_Variant_Rule)") on initiative 20. The spell save DC is 13.

The Haunted Library of the Mad Mage is a towering, 100ft-tall space of twisted, looping staircases, a labyrinth of shelves and full to bursting with books on every topic conceivable. It is also ruled by the Librarian, a Class 5 Full Roaming Vapor that values silence and order. The Librarian will not attack unless provoked by threats, noise, or general disruption of the library. The Librarian appears in its spectral form as a kindly old woman, but when irritated transforms its visage into a shrieking creature of nightmares and attacks.
