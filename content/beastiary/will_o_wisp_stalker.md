      **Incorporeal Movement** The will-o'-wisp stalker can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

      **Variable Illumination** The will-o'-wisp stalker sheds bright light in a 5- to 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional number of feet equal to the chosen radius. The will-o'-wisp stalker can alter the radius as a bonus action.

      **Ephemeral** The will-o'-wisp stalker can't wear or carry anything.

      ## Actions

      **Consume Life** As a bonus action, the will-o'-wisp stalker can target one creature it can see within 5 feet of it that has 0 hit points and is still alive. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw against this magic or die. If the target dies, the will-o'-wisp stalker regains 10 (3d6) hit points.

      **Shock** Melee Spell Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 9 (2d8) lightning damage.

      **Invisibility** As a bonus action, the will-o'-wisp stalker and its light magically become invisible. The effect lasts until the will-o'-wisp stalker attacks or uses Consume Life, or until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). 


      ## Reactions

      **Shock** The will-o'-wisp stalker can cast Shock as an opportunity atack.

      ## Lair and Lair Actions

      **Stalking Fog** The will-o'-wisp stalker's lair is filled with a 1000 ft cube of dense magical fog 20 feet in height. Creatures within the fog can only see to a distance of 15 ft and no sound travels more than 30 ft. Creatures within the fog may suffer minor auditory and visual hallucinations.

      The fog can be dispelled using a Dispel Magic spell or moved with sufficiently powerful air currents. The effect will last up to 1 minute, after which the lair begins to refill with fog.

      **Culling Fog** On initiative count 20 one random creature within the fog may be teleported up to 500 feet in a random direction to an empty space elsewhere within the fog.

Will-O'-Wisp Stalkers are usually found in deep in forests, swamps, and bogs where their magical fog can be mistaken as normal weather and lure unsuspecting victims to their death. They will not attack large groups, preferring to first confuse targets with hallucinations and then rely on the **Culling Fog** to isolate targets.

In combat Will-O'-Wisp Stalkers will follow a predictable pattern of swarming a single target with Shock attacks and then turning invisible, making a swarm a dangerous and challenging encounter for any adventurer unlucky enough to be separated from their party.
