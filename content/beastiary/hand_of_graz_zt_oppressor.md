      **Ethereal Chains** The Hand of Graz'zt Oppressors are support units that control the battlefield using ethereal spiked chains. Attacks with the Chain of Oppression ignore cover and the chains will pass through solid objects until they reach their intended target. 

      ## Actions

      **Multiattack** The Oppressor makes two attacks with its Mace of Oppression, or one attack with Chain of Oppression.

      **Mace of Oppression** *melee* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 1d8+2 piercing damage and 2d6 necrotic damage.

      **Chain of Oppression** *ranged spell attack* +9 to hit, 30/60ft., up to 3 targets. 3d6 piercing damage. On a hit, the target must succeed on a DEX 19 saving throw or be grappled. As long as the target remains grappled, they take 3d6 piercing damage at the start of their turn.

      ## Bonus Actions

      **Yank** The Oppressor can pull up to three creatures grappled with Chain of Oppression 10 feet directly towards it. The chains pass through solid objects, but the grappled creature does not.
