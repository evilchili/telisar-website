    description: |
        The bearer of this figurine may spend an action to set the switch, turn the crank, and place the statuette on a flat surface, pointing it at a humanoid target that can see it within 30 feet. The selected target must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or suffer the effects associated with the selected animal:

        **Pig** Any attempt to use verbal language results in meaningless grunts, snorts and squealing. For the duration, the target cannot be understood except by pigs, or via the Speak With Animals spell. While effected, the target take any action requiring spoken language.

        **Monkey** The target is compelled to drop anything in its hands and clap in time with the monkey's cymbals. For the duration, the target cannot take any action requiring the use of its hands. 

        **Duck** The target is compelled to waddle like a duck, and for the duration its walking speed is 5ft. On its turn, the target must move to the nearest unoccupied space, possibly provoking opportunity attacks. If there is no unoccupied space within 5ft, the target waddles in place. 

        An effected target may repeat the Wisdom saving throw at the end of its turn. If a target succeeds its saving throw, it is immune to the effects of the figurine for 24 hours. Otherwise, the effect persists for one minute while the clockwork is functioning, the target is within 30ft, and the target can see the figurine.

        Each effect can only be used once per day. A Dispel Magic spell will permanently remove all magical properties of this item, though the clockwork mechanisms will continue to function.

A hand-made wood and brass statuette 4" in diameter and 12" tall,  depicting a duck, riding a monkey, riding a pig. There is a switch on the back of the figurine with three positions, one for each animal. On the underside of the base is a small inscription reading "With gratitude, Muzzah Myrndottir." When the monkey's tail is cranked the internal clockwork animates the figures for one minute: the pig appears to walk in place, the monkey bangs tiny cymbals together, and the duck opens and closes its beak as if quacking.
