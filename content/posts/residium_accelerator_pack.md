        **Unlicensed Magon Collider** The pack is a complex and experimental fusion of arcane power and science lacking many safeguards. Any creature wearing or holding metal while using the Confinement Stream action takes 7 (2d6) lightning damage and must succeed on a DC 15 CON saving throw or be stunned for one round.

        **Don't Cross the Streams** If the Confinement Streams of two or more Residium Accelerator Packs intersect, a total magonic reversal originating at the point of intersection causes a gate to the Astral Plane to be created. Anything within 10 ft of the gate is sucked through and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate is then destroyed in an explosion and everything in a 100 ft. radius sphere takes 85 (10d10 + 35) force damage, is pushed back 10 ft and is knocked prone. Creatures within the area of effect succeeding on a DEX 19 saving throw take half damage and are not knocked prone. The resonance of the arcane explosion permanently destroys the enchantments of any Residium Accelerator Pack in the area of effect and shatters its residium crystals.

        ## Actions

        When equipped, the Residium Accelerator Pack grants the following actions:

        **Confinement Stream** *Ranged Spell Attack* +0 hit, 60 ft., one target. You may add either your DEX or STR modifier to the attack roll. On a hit the target takes 7 (2d6) lightning damage. If the 
        target is incorporeal (as ajudicated by the DM), it is restrained until the start of your next turn, or until it succeeds on a DC 13 STR saving throw at the end of its next turn. The DC increases by one for every additional Confinement Stream currently restraining the target.

        If your attack misses your target, it hits a random object in the environment which takes the damage instead. If the object is flammable, it ignites.

        **Hold** If your Confinement Stream is restraining a target at the start of your turn, you can use your action to continue restraining the target with the Confinement Stream. The target takes 7 (2d6) lightning damage. You may also move the target 15ft in any direction.

The Residium Accelerator Pack is a two-handed magical weapon designed to restrain free-roaming vapors, spooks, spectres and ghosts on the Material Plane. It consists of a steel wand embedded into a wooden battle-axe handle grip, with a residium crystal tip. The weapon is connected by means of thick leather braids to a heavy, square wooden plank 3ft on a side. The plank has shoulder straps affixed on one side; on the other it is enscribed a complicated arcane ritual circle consisting of various foci, crystals, copper tubing, mirrors, spheres, and arcane sigils hammered out of precious metals. At the center of the sigil is another sliver of residium. The crystal tip of the wand is wrapped in a cage of delicate platinum wiring which wraps the length of the wand and is woven into the leather braiding, connecting eventually to the arcane circuit board. A small switch on the grip activates the device, which emits a worrying hum.
