Bartok Brescht is the Captain-General of the Uman City Watch and the leader of House Brescht, one
of the seven ruling families of Uman. He is a towering, imposing half-orc standing 6'6" with broad
shoulders and a powerful, barrel-chested physique. His skin is grey, turning faintly greenish at the
extremities. His eyes, too, are green, piercing and intelligent. Bartok's salt-and-pepper hair, worn
in a short military cut, is the only evidence of his age; perhaps his early 60s. Bartok's incisor
tusks are small white points protruding just above his lower lip, more closely resembling inverted
fangs than horn. His wide cheekbones, square jaw and prominent nose bridge combined with a
relentless tenacity in pursuit of justice have gained him the nickname The Bull Terrier amongst the
rank and file of the Watch, though never within his hearing.

Bartok was the 2nd-born son of Drakosh and his wife Umila Brescht. While his elder brother Belik was
groomed to follow in Drakosh's footsteps as Captain-General of the Watch, Bartok spent his
adolescence as an acolyte of Bahamut, dividing his time between studies in the Umani Temple of
Bahamut and on mission in the wild lands of Telisar. In his late 20s he married Aralir am Yvia, a
half-elf he met on mission; the two settled in Zikrin's Eyes, a town in Eastriver.
Little is known of Bartok's life during this period.

On the morning of his 41st birthday, word reached Bartok that Drakosh and Belik had both been killed
while defending Uman from an attack; the Watch was in disarray and House Brescht left leaderless in
the city, his mother Umila having died several years prior. Bartok and Aralir returned to Uman with
their infant son. Bartok, now a paladin of Woden and bearing a formidable enchanted maul as
a symbol of his office, declared himself Captain-General of the Watch, and in less than a year had
brought the unruly organization to heel, while Aralir proved to be a fearsome leader of the Brescht
family's interests.

Brescht's unwavering, rigid view of justice quickly brought him to odds with Uman's other noble
houses, notably the Simbali and the Pashtum, who for years had enjoyed unchecked profiteering at the
expense of Uman's most vulnerable citizens. Brescht stamped down on activities he declared unjust,
and over the next two decades the city and its Watch Captain-General learned to tolerate one
another. Brescht's domineering influence brought a measure of peace to Uman, though tensions with
the noble Houses has never lessened.

Bartok is inflexible and dogmatic, distrusting of politics and does not suffer fools. His unwavering
confidence in his own opinion of what is right has more than once escalated conflicts within the
city as the Watch has come into direct opposition with both its ruling Houses and its underworld
elements. Despite this, Bartok's reputation is of a man not to be crossed, and the sheer force of
his will has kept Uman more-or-less at peace for over 20 years.

**Paladin of Woden** Bartok is a Paladin of Woden, God of Justice. His spellcasting ability is
Charisma (Spell Attack +4, Spell Save DC 12). He can cast the following spells:

1st Level: (4 slots) Command, Cure Wounds, Protection From Evil and Good, Sanctuary

2nd Level: (3 slots) Aid, Lesser Restoration, Zone of Truth

3rd Level: (2 slots) Beacon of Hope, Dispel Magic, Remove Curse, Revivify


## Actions

**Multiattack** Bartok makes two attacks with Woden's Promise.

**Woden's Promise** *Melee Weapon* +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 2d6+7 Bludgeoning damage.

Bartok gains a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. The maul has 5
charges. While attuned to it, after hitting with a melée attack, Bartok may choose to expend one
charge to unleash a thunderclap audible out to 300 feet. The target and every creature within 30
feet of it must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your
next turn. The maul regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn.

**Unarmed Strike** Melee Attack +10 to hit, reach 5ft., one target. Hit: 7 Bludgeoning damage.

**Channel Divinity: Sacred Weapon** As an action Bartok can imbue a weapon with positive energy. For
1 minute, the weapon is considered magical, you add +1 to attack rolls, it emits bright light for 20
ft. and dim light for 20 ft beyond that. Bartok can end the effect as part of any other action, if
you are no longer holding the weapon, or if you fall unconscious.

**Channel Divinity: Turn the Unholy** As an action, Bartok can censure fiends and undead. Each fiend or
undead that can see or hear him within 30 ft. must make a WIS saving throw (DC 12). On failure, it
is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.

**Divine Sense** As an action, Bartok can detect good and evil. Until the end of your next turn, he 
can sense anything affected by the hallow spell or know the location of any celestial, fiend, undead
within 60 ft. that is not behind total cover. He can use this action once per long rest.

**Lay on Hands** Bartok has a pool of healing power that can restore 50 HP per long rest. As an
action, he can touch a creature to restore any number of HP remaining in the pool, or 5 HP to
either cure a disease or neutralize a poison affecting the creature.

**Divine Smite (Special)** When Bartok hits with a melee weapon attack, he can expend one spell slot to
deal 2d8 extra radiant damage to the target plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st (max 5d8)
and plus 1d8 against undead or fiends.

**Relentless Endurance (Special)**
When Bartok is reduced to 0 HP but not killed, he can drop to 1 HP instead once per long rest.

**Savage Attacks** When Bartok scores a critical hit with a melee weapon attack, he can roll one of
the weapon’s damage dice one additional time and add it to the extra damage of the critical hit.

## Reactions

**Protection** While wielding a shield and a creature Bartok can see attacks a target other than him 
within 5 ft., he can use his reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll.
