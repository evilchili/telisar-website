    type: Wonderous Item
    rarity: Artifact
    description: |
        Any living creature wearing this hat on their head must make a DC 18 wisdom saving throw or be permanently transformed into a frog, with all the game statistics, including mental ability scores, except HP and Maximum HP, which are retained.

        When the hat is placed on a target, make a contested Dexterity check for the owner of the hat and the frog. If the owner wins, the frog is considered grappled, and the user may choose to secure the clasp. If the frog wins the contested check, the clasp remains unsecured and the frog is not grappled.

        The hat fits snugly upon the frog's head; if the clasp is secured, the
        frog can move freely without removing the hat. If the clasp is not
        secured, each time the frog moves, it must make a DC 12 Strength
        (Acrobatics) check. If it succeeds, the hat is dislodged and the
        effect is ended.

        The effect is ended by removing the hat, being knocked unconscious or killed, or with the effects of a wish spell. Once the effect is ended, the target creature is immune to its effects for 24 hours.

A small green leather skullcap, with two bulbous white eyes atop it and a chin strap whose clasp is reminiscent of a three-toed frog's feet. Keen obtained this artifact by cheating Lord Shimmerscale, a fairy dragon living in the Feywild, at cards.
