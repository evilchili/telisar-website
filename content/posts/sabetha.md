{{< figure link="/static/NPCs/sabetha.png" thumb="-thumb" class="portrait float-right" >}}{{< class "text" >}} A graduate of Madame Elethi's Finishing School For Girls, Sabetha (she/her) is a refined, educated and brilliant woman. A gifted dancer, she performs often at Zandilar's, the club and casino owned by Madame Elethi. She is also rumoured to be Elethi's most trusted lieutenant: a dangerous and capable assassin, tracker and spellcaster so feared that much of Madame Elethi's reputation as a woman not to be crossed may be attributed to her having Sabetha at her command.

Sabetha is a blue-skinned tiefling standing 5'10" with long, powerful legs, slim, muscular torso and graceful neck. Her tail is longer than average, and thinner, almost whip-like. Her eyes, intelligent and piercing, are grey/red. Her snow-white hair is spiky, longer on top than at the back and falls slightly forward to partially obscure two forward-inclined horns, each roughly broken at about 6" of length. An old wound of significance, it would be unwise to question her regarding them. Her demeanour is that of a coiled snake, ready to strike: deadly calm, wary, and confident. Beautiful
though she is, it is said that Sabetha's smile is terrible, like a lioness contemplating her next meal. A mystique no doubt aided by being mute; Sabetha never speaks aloud, but communicates -- when she chooses to do so at all -- with telepathy alone.

A gifted spellcaster, Sabetha perfers to work from the shadows using misdirection and subterfuge, resorting to open combat only when necessary. Sabetha's signature weapons are a pair of matched fighting fans, each ribbed with steel and extending to a 2" point beyond the white paper edge. When
collapsed the ribs align into a pronged stabbing weapon; open the fans are vicious slashing weapons which she uses to deadly effect in close-quarters combat, her movements equal parts dancer and martial artist. She wears assassin's leather died a deep indigo, almost black.

As mysterious and deadly as she is, those lucky enough to see Sabetha dance on stage at Zandilar's often remark on the great emotional depth of her performance, which silently conveys an ennui, a melancholy so profound as to leave audiences in tears.

**Innate Spellcaster** Sabetha's spellcasting ability is Charisma (Spell Attack +9, Spell Save DC 19). She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

At Will: Chill Touch, Frosbite, Message, Prestidigitation, Thaumaturgy, True Strike, Comprehend Languages, Telepathy

Thrice Per Day Each: Misty Step, Dimension Door, Detect Thoughts, Darkness

Once Per Long Rest Each: Disguise Self, Sleep, Hold Person, Teleportation Circle, Animate Objects.

**Assassinate** During her first turn, Sabetha has advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn. Any hit Sabetha scores against a surprised creature is a critical hit.

**Evasion** If Sabetha is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, Sabetha instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.

## Actions

**Multiattack** Sabetha makes up to two Fan attacks, one for each fan she possesses. The attacks use her Charisma (Performance) bonus.

**Fan** *Melee Weapon Attack* +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 1d8 +5 slashing damage.

**Unarmed Strike** *Melee Attack*, +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 3 bludgeoning damage.

**Sneak Attack (Special)** Once per turn, Sabetha can deal an extra 2d6 damage to one creature she hits with an attack with a finesse or ranged weapon if she has advantage on the attack roll. Sabeth doesn’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 ft. of it, that enemy isn’t incapacitated, and she doesn’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.

**Strength of the Grave (Special)** When damage (that isn't radiant or from a critical hit) reduces Sabetha to 0 HP, she can make a CHA saving throw (DC 5 + the damage taken). On a success, she instead drops to 1 HP (and can't use this feature again until she finishes a long rest).

**Convert Sorcery Points** Sabetha can use her sorcery points to gain additional spell slots or sacrifice spell slots to gain additional sorcery points as a bonus action.

**Cunning Action** Sabetha can take a bonus action on each of her turns to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.

**Hound of Ill Omen** As a bonus action, Sabetha can spend 3 sorcery points to magically summon a hound of ill omen (modified dire wolf) to target one creature she can see within 120 ft. of her.

## Reactions

**Hellish Rebuke**
