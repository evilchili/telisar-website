The stone is standing<br>
Where water is breaking<br>
The sentinel in darkness<br>
Protects the path<br>
<p>
The stone is standing<br>
Where hills are rising<br>
The Green Way Arch<br>
Atop the stairway of bone<br>
<p>
The stone is standing<br>
On Odebelioth's Bluff<br>
On the way to al Ilised<br>
South to our home<br>
<p>
The stone is standing<br>
Though lost you may be<br>
The stone will always<br>
Lead you back home<br>
