    name: "Madame Elethi's Ledger"
    type: Wondrous Item
    rarity: Uncommon
    description: |
        A black leathbound book, 7 inches by 5 inches, containing hundreds of
        pages of encoded messages belonging to the Vampire Madame Elethi. Its
        contents, onced decoded, detail a long history of business, legal by
        the laws of Uman, of assassination and other bounty work. It also
        includes a roster of Elethi's Wards, a group of powerful Shadow Dancer
        assassins in training, employed by Elethi for the most sensitive jobs.

        Finally and most concerningly, the ledger contains detailed notes and
        research on prominent members of each of the seven noble merchant
        families that together rule the city. Elethi has used this knowledge
        to maintain her position of influence in the city and an uneasy peace
        between the families, each of whom paid her substantial sums to ensure
        that should any one family attempt to grab power from another, their
        secrets would be exposed.

        **Enduring** The ledger has the properties of an Enduring Spellbook: it, along with anything written on its pages, can't be damaged by fire or immersion in water. In addition, the ledger doesn't deteriorate with age.

### PASHTUM

* Interests: Banking
* Predominant Ancestry: Human
* Current Head: Thorus (Elouise)

#### Dossiers

**Thorus Pashtum (3119 - )** Male. Rarely seen in public since 3180s. Suspect mental decline. Shrewd, petty, cruel.

**Mali Pashtum (3132 - 3198)** Female. First wife to Thorus.

**Elouise Pashtum (3174 - )** Female. Married Thorus 3199. Real power. Obsessed with legitimacy, propriety, appearances.

**Gynaral Pashtum (3167 - 3188)** Female. Twin sister to Temon. Graduate, class of 3187. Slain by Belik Brescht while executing #371.

**Temon Pashtum (3169 - ?)**: Male. Twin brother to Gynaral. Left Uman 3188 following death of Gynaral.

**Jeffry Pashtum (3187 - 3206)** Male, human. Began clerking at the Bank in 3204. Gambler. UPDATE: Killed (#397) after losing deposits intended for the vault while gambling.

#### General Comments

Founding family. Rose to prominence extremely quickly; suspect initial financial backing provided by outside sources. Provides favourable but profitable financial services for 3rd and up; usury and extortion common at 4th tier and below. Influence established through cultural pressure: Umani citizens now consider direct exchange of funds impolite(!). Legitimacy conferred by Bank as intermediary. "Scrip" a recent initiative to further restrict free capital flow and exert pressure on newer merchant enterprises.

#### Regarding the Pashtum Bank

* Outer vault protections include classic Duergar security (gas, arrows, flood chamber), full platoon of guards (6hr rotating shifts, 20 minute patrols, barracks on-site).
* Inner vault guarded by enslaved Beholder (control method unknown; related regular shipments from Simbali Warehouse 6? Should investigate)
* Maintenance tunnels accessible internally via guard barracks, 3rd level. Layout suggests presence of ventilation; surveys required.
* Vault is planar portal to lair of Baishefalaxus. Precise location unknown. Terms of contract/indenture unknown.
    
Contracts requiring direct action on Bank not advisable. Duergar security circumvented by maintenance access (guard assets) but no known countermeasures for beholder, and no leverage on dragon. Exfiltration with any significant assets improbable without significant resistance; Watch involvement likely.

#### Intelligence

* Thorus and Elouise affair began in 3191 
* Elouise paid kitchen staff to poison Mali circa 3195?
* Jeffry bastard by Elouise, though officially recorded as son of Mali
* Temon now a high-ranking Skink. Blames Thorus for deaths of Gynaral and Jeffry. Useful asset against family interests if made aware of Elouise's role in deaths. Whereabouts valuable intel for Elouise.
* One student per year provided to Pashtum family, on condition student be reported as killed to family. Students disappear; reasons unknown. Efforts to locate post facto unsuccessful thus far.
