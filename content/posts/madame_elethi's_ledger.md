    name: "Madame Elethi's Ledger"
    type: Wondrous Item
    rarity: Uncommon
    description: |
        A black leathbound book, 7 inches by 5 inches, containing hundreds of
        pages of encoded messages belonging to the Vampire Madame Elethi. Its
        contents, onced decoded, detail a long history of business, legal by
        the laws of Uman, of assassination and other bounty work. It also
        includes a roster of Elethi's Wards, a group of powerful Shadow Dancer
        assassins in training, employed by Elethi for the most sensitive jobs.

        Finally and most concerningly, the ledger contains detailed notes and
        research on prominent members of each of the seven noble merchant
        families that together rule the city. Elethi has used this knowledge
        to maintain her position of influence in the city and an uneasy peace
        between the families, each of whom paid her substantial sums to ensure
        that should any one family attempt to grab power from another, their
        secrets would be exposed.

        **Enduring** The ledger has the properties of an Enduring Spellbook: it, along with anything written on its pages, can't be damaged by fire or immersion in water. In addition, the ledger doesn't deteriorate with age.

### PASHTUM

* Interests: Banking
* Predominant Ancestry: Human
* Current Head: Thorus (Elouise)

#### Dossiers

**Thorus Pashtum (3119 - )** Male. Rarely seen in public since 3180s. Suspect mental decline. Shrewd, petty, cruel.

**Mali Pashtum (3132 - 3198)** Female. First wife to Thorus.

**Elouise Pashtum (3174 - )** Female. Married Thorus 3199. Real power. Obsessed with legitimacy, propriety, appearances.

**Gynaral Pashtum (3167 - 3188)** Female. Twin sister to Temon. Graduate, class of 3187. Slain by Belik Brescht while executing #371.

**Temon Pashtum (3167 - ?)**: Male. Twin brother to Gynaral. Left Uman 3188 following death of Gynaral.

**Jeffry Pashtum (3187 - 3206)** Male. Began clerking at the Bank in 3204. Gambler. UPDATE: Killed (#397) after losing deposits intended for the vault while gambling. Known associates: Rimbal Knacklebun, Drakosh Brescht.

#### General Comments

Founding family. Rose to prominence extremely quickly; suspect initial financial backing provided by outside sources. Provides favourable but profitable financial services for 3rd and up; usury and extortion common at 4th tier and below. Influence established through cultural pressure: Umani citizens now consider direct exchange of funds impolite(!). Legitimacy conferred by Bank as intermediary. "Scrip" a recent initiative to further restrict free capital flow and exert pressure on newer merchant enterprises.

#### Regarding the Pashtum Bank

* Outer vault protections include classic Duergar security (gas, arrows, flood chamber), full platoon of guards (6hr rotating shifts, 20 minute patrols, barracks on-site).
* Inner vault guarded by enslaved Beholder (control method unknown; related regular shipments from Simbali Warehouse 6? Should investigate)
* Maintenance tunnels accessible internally via guard barracks, 3rd level. Layout suggests presence of ventilation; surveys required.
* Vault is planar portal to lair of Baishefalaxus. Precise location unknown. Terms of contract/indenture unknown.
    
Contracts requiring direct action on Bank not advisable. Duergar security circumvented by maintenance access (guard assets) but no known countermeasures for beholder, and no leverage on dragon. Exfiltration with any significant assets improbable without significant resistance; Watch involvement likely.

#### Intelligence

* Thorus and Elouise affair began in 3191 
* Elouise paid kitchen staff to poison Mali circa 3195?
* Jeffry bastard by Elouise, though officially recorded as son of Mali
* Temon now a high-ranking Skink. Blames Thorus for deaths of Gynaral and Jeffry. Useful asset against family interests if made aware of Elouise's role in deaths. Whereabouts valuable intel for Elouise.
* One student per year provided to Pashtum family, on condition student be reported as killed to family. Students disappear; reasons unknown. Efforts to locate post facto unsuccessful thus far.


### BRESCHT

* Interests: Watch, private security, weapons merchants
* Predominant Ancestry: Half-Orc
* Current Heads: Bartok, Aralir

#### Dossiers

**Drakosh (3129 - 3188)** Father to Belik and Bartok. Killed (#371). Brother Master Inquisitor, Martial Order of Bahamut (ex-communicated; circumstances unclear). Captain-General of the Watch, 3168 - 3174. Taciturn, severe, inflexible. Abandoned official duties following death of Umila.

**Umila (3117 - 3169)** Wife to Drakosh, mother to Belik and Bartok. Died of disease. Mudslide Pits Unarmed Champion 3149 - 3155. Ex-mercenary. Details of relationship with Drakosh unknown. Responsible for expanding Brescht interests into private security and weapons.

**Belik (3144 - 3188)** First-born son. Captain-General of the Watch beginning 3170, succeeding Drakosh. Naive, petty, quick-to-anger. Inflexible as Drakosh and tough as Umila but lacking both shrewdness and vision. City Watch infiltrated, controlled by competing interests during his tenure. Killed (#371). Suspect failed attempt to blackmail House Simbali.

**Bartok (3147 - )** Second-born son. Martial Order of Bahamut 3162 - ??,  known rank of Brother Defender of the Light (Cleric). Married Aralir am Yvia 3177, relocated to Zikrin's Eyes (?). Joined Temple of Woden (Paladin) date unknown. Assumed Captain-General of City Watch 3188 following deaths of Drakosh and Belik. Genuinely believes in justice; believes he is the avatar of Woden in Uman.

**Aralir am Yvia (3103  - )** Wife to Bartok. Half-elf. History prior to 3188 unknown. Runs family business interests, turning increased profits yearly 3192 onward, predominantly on external investments. Avoids expansion of business in Uman. Rarely seen in public.

**Drakosh (3186 - )** Son of Bartok and Aralir. Known associates: Jeffry Pashtum, Rimbal Knacklebun. Adolescence spent in petty crime, theft, vandalism. Left Uman 3200; whereabouts unknown but likely Eastriver.

#### General Notes

Founding family. Financial status prior to diversification strained, reliant on protection fees. Bulk of wealth now from private guard contracts (3rd Tier and up), mine security, caravan escorts, smithing and weapons trading. Watch funded through common taxation administered through Pashtum Bank.

#### Regarding the Watch

The Uman City Watch under Bartok Brescht has become an efficient and trusted organization. Longstanding contracts with House Myrndottir provide enchanted and anti-magic tooling. Bartok's elite guard formidable warriors, trained by Bartok himself. Direct confrontation with guard acceptable for appropriate contract remuneration, but elite guard involvement likely to include Bartok directly; not recommended.

Parties deemed "Threat to the Peace" are disappeared. Brescht compound on 2nd Tier rumoured to house secret high-security prison compound. All attempts to secure access or intelligence unsuccessful thus far.

#### Intelligence

* Drakosh, J. Pashtum, R. Knacklebun formed gang ("Kings of Uman") circa 3198. Suspects in death of wine merchant in Simbali compound, 3199. Investigation squashed by Bartok Brescht. Suspect blackmail of House Pashtum by House Simbali to exert pressure on Brescht.

* Legal protection for Wards operations, bounties within Uman established 3121, renewed 3181. Bartok bound by House honor to provide guarantee of safe passage for all operatives involved in registered bounties (see pp. 13 - 18). 

* Brescht likely to deal if integrity of Watch threatened or safety of 5th and lower threatened, but easily provoked. Any direct threats to family likely to encounter extreme response.

### MYRNDOTTIR

* Interests: Manufacturing, Alchemy, Arcane Research
* Predominant Ancestry: Dwarf, Human
* Current Head: Kirshen

#### Dossiers

**Muzzah (2914 - 3116)** Half-Dwarf, father of Kirshen. Wizard, artificer. Died of natural causes. Repeat client (#317, #323, #324, #351). 

**Hyel (3021 - 3204)** Half-Dwarf. Husband to Kirshen. Died of natural causes.

**Kirshen (3101? - )** Human. Mother to Ciyâch, Ginny and Janey. Wizard. Kindly, gentle-spoken. Extremely Paranoid. Controls House interests, directly managing arcane and alchemical concerns.

**Ciyâch (3163 - )** Human male. First-born to Kirshen and Hyel. Ostensibly manages mining industry subsidiaries, reporting to Kirshen. 

**Ginny, Janey (3179 - )** Identical twin daughters to Kirshen and Hyel. Human. Left Uman 3199. Graduates, class of 3198. Service waived for compensation rendered. Known agents of Skink. Known associates: Henry Smalls, Lord Blackwell, Keen. 

#### General Notes

Founding family. Secured long-standing contracts with Houses Rasmusson and  Knacklebun to supply industrial machinery, gem, mineral and ore processing. Contracted to House Brescht for anti-magic defense and enchantments. Muzzah repeatedly targeted key arcane / artificer innovators in other houses to maintain primacy, secured House's expansive wealth. Kirshen borne 3101, assumed control of House interests 3124. Expanded on enchanting and defensive armaments business to both Watch and private concerns, under the "Grandmother Myrndottir's" subsidiary.

#### Intelligence

* Kirshen powerful arcane practitioner and extremely paranoid. Direct confrontation with House not recommended. Dotes on Ciyâch; leverage by threatening son's safety or reputation. Can be provoked by suggestion of unknown enemies plotting against House interests.
* Ciyâch: idiot. Business affairs maintained quietly by staff unbeknownst to  Kirshen.
* Ginny and Janey sent to employ of Lord Blackwell 3199; joined Spectacular Spectacular shortly thereafter. Graduates; school records indicate gifted practitioners of spycraft.
* House dealings with Skink apparent result of extorted or leveraged position. Circumstances unclear but Kirshen clearly under Blackwell influence; internal Uman contracts being delayed in favour of external shipments. Brescht likely to take dim view of Skink business.

### KNACKLEBUN

* Interests: Mining (metals)
* Predominant Ancestry: gnome
* Current Heads: Panaver, Glintering

#### Dossiers

**Glintering (3054 - )** Male. Formerly employed by House Rasmusson; co-founded Knacklebun Silver Mine 3172 with Panaver. Crass, rough, speciesist. Intensely disliked by most Houses. Husband to Panaver (married 3172).

**Panaver (3043 - )** Male. Formerly employed by House Rasmusson; Husband to Glintering. Vain. Inferiority complex. Hates dwarfs, Wiph Rasmusson in particular.

**Panaver Rimbal (3186 - )** First-born son (surrogate) to Glintering and Panaver. Known associates: Jeffry Pashtum, Drakosh Brescht. Adolescence spent in petty crime, theft, vandalism.

#### General Comments

House established 3172. Purchased remaining House Throgdottir assets following collapse 3184. Glintering and Panaver both former employees of House Rasmusson. Repeatedly agitated for miner's rights. Established Umani Rock Gnome Precious Metals Mining Collective, 3168, drawing conflict from both House Rasumusson and House Fullfoot.

House Knacklebun viewed either with disdain or bemusement by founding families, but financial positioning solid due extremely lucky strikes on major silver and iron veins. Rasmusson and Knacklebun openly hostile, competitive over mining rights in Redfall hills.

House has expanded rapidly, with many 3rd and 4th-tier concerns headed by extended Knacklebun family. By custom, first-born sons expected to be named Panaver in deference to head of family.

#### Intelligence

* Knacklebun rights to first silver vein secured by contract theft of new Rasmusson prospector reports (#367). First-born sons expected to provide aid and assistance to Wards on contract when asked.
* Umani Rock Gnome Precious Metals Mining Collective enjoys unwavering support from Gnomish population; only guild to be sanctioned by the city not controlled by Fullfoot.
* Rimbal kidnapped by The Community, fanatics following Mera Maryndottir. Rescued by Keen and Associates; motivations unknown. 

### SIMBALI

* Interests: Brewing, Wine, Spirits, transport, intelligence
* Predominant ancestry: Elf
* Current Head: Selarine 

#### Dossiers

*Selarine* (?? - ) Male elf of advanced age; date of birth unknown. Projects magnanimity and good cheer. Prominent member, Temple of Freya. Hedonist. Personal history unknown.

#### General Notes

Founding family. Extensive land holdings throughout Telisar, notably: Simbali Eastriver Vineyards (el Qatra), Simbali Redfall, and Simbali 7 Isles. Notable commercial interests include Simbali Uman (wine, spirits), Simbali el Astrum (information, research, intelligence?),  Simbali Transport (import/export, trade caravans, mercenary companies?). Financial status unknown; majority of holdings managed outside Pashtum Bank.

Reputation obviously fabricated but no-one willing to speak against Selarine. Prefers misdirection, proxied leverage through intermediaries to direct action.

Dangerous. Contracts contrary to Simbali interests not advisable.

#### Intelligence

* Uman founding charter (2694 M.E.) includes signature of "S. Simbali;" Selarine claims this is him. Uncorroborated, but possible. 
* Suspected financial support of House Pashtum during construction of Pashtum Bank, circa 2700
* Simbali Uman compound (2nd Tier) includes several warehouses; bulk of wine stores, spirits housed on-site.
* Contract with Pashtum Bank for regular seasonal deliveries from warehouses, 9 barrels, per, contents unknown.
* Suspected involvement in #371, death of Drakosh, Umila and Belik Pashtum, 3188. Contract secured by K. Myrndottir; suspect Selarine response to failed blackmail attempt by Belik.
* Suspected involvement in collapse of House Throgdottir, 3184
* Suspected financial involvement with Skink, circa 3190s
* Suspected financial involvement with Danta Kosht, circa 3200
* Suspected blackmail of E. Pashtum to pressure Brescht over suppression of investigation into death of wine merchant, 3199
* "Simbali Private Reserves" consists of five different wines: Simbali Red, Simbali White, Simbali Green, Simbali Blue, Simbali Black. Sold as luxury brand wines, but when mixed with particular alchemical catalysts provide  arcane influence. Simbali Black mixed with powdered black opal yields effects similar to Zone of Truth spell. Other catalysts unknown.
* Knowledge of Private Reserve catalysts possible leverage?
