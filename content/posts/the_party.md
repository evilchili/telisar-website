The Heart of Winter has been transformed into a multi-level night club and is hosting a party for guests from across the realms. Looking down over the massive, multi-tiered space is Mab, sat upon her throne in a garden of ice and attended by the assembled Lords and Ladies of Winter at the Queen's Table. 

Fey social gatherings are deadly contests of politics, prestige, and scrupulously polite betrayals. The rules of indebtedness are suspended as all invited guests are subject to the host's hospitality and under their protection, which frees up party-goers to be just as conniving and duplicitous as they wish without risking planes-ending feuds. Every guest's ultimate goal is to be publicly recognized by the host. 

Your objective is to get from the party's entrance to the Queen's Table by impressing enough party-goers that the queen would lose face by rejecting your audience. There are several distinct areas within the space, in which various opportunities to gain prestige are available. Any combination of party members may attend each area, but each one can only be visited by the party once and you may not have time to visit them all. Magic, slight of hand, trickery, deception and cheating are not only encouraged but expected, but outright lies -- especially clumsy ones -- are considered gauche.

Prestige Rewards:
- 5-20: An audience with Mab with disadvantage on all charisma checks
- 21-30: An audience with Mab
- 31 or more: An audience with Mab with advantage on all charisma checks

Rules:
- Each time you are caught in an outright lie costs you -3 prestige points
- You may eat and drink freely
- Rules of indebtedness (the obligations from giving or receiving thanks, gifts, advice, and other debts) are suspended for invited party-goers

{{< spoiler title="The Bar" >}}
A group of six pixies challenging party-goers to a drinking contest between teams of drinkers. Teams may be evenly matched(e.g. 3 on 3), or one team may choose a handicap (4 on 6, 2 on 3, 1 on 3, etc).

Prestige:
* +1 if you engage in a drinking contest.
* +1 for your team's handicap: +0 for 3 on 3, +1 for 2 on 3, and so on.
* +5 if you win a drinking contest.

Rules:
1. Roll for initiative using your Constitution modifier.
1. On your turn, the barkeep fills your mug with a random liquid chosen by rolling a d100 on the drinks table. 
1. Drink! Resolve the effects, if any.
1. If you're still in, make a Constitution saving throw (DC 10 + Round Number). If you fail, you vomit and are incapacitated for one minute.
1. At the end of your turn, you may use one action or bonus action.

If at any time on your turn you become incapacitated, unconscious, or choose to quit, you are eliminated from play and the opposing team gets one point. Play continues until one team is eliminated; the team with the most points wins.

{{< spoiler title="The Lounge" >}}

The lounge area consists of multiple small groups of party-goers in conversation. People exchange stories, jokes, riddles, and gossip in an attempt to both impress and charm their circle. They are also seeking to uncover secrets, alliances, and subterfuge. Prestige is gained by being the most interesting, witty, and entertaining guest.

Prestige:
* +1 for each round spent telling a story, joke, riddle, gossip, to a maximum of 3 rounds
* +1 for each listener that remains in your group after you're finished speaking.

Rules:
* Round 1 begins with a player (the storyteller) and 3 listeners.
* The storyteller begin telling their joke, story, gossip, etc. The DM will call for one or more ability checks as the speakers continue.
* For each successful ability check, the group attracts a listener. On a failure, a listener moves off.
* Once per round, each party member in attendance may choose to assist the storyteller with an ability check, or use their action to try to lure more listeners in. This could be in the form of additional gossip, a quick joke, a bribe, or anything else they can think of.
* A storyteller (either the same or a new PC in attendance) can choose to start a new round with the existing group of listeners, to a maximum of three rounds, or stop.
* The game ends immediately if there area zero listeners at the end of a round.

Bonus prestige may be awarded if the party is able to trick listeners in the group into an embarrassing admission or reveal secrets that grant a political advantage to one faction or another within the Fey.

{{< spoiler title="The Gaming Pit" >}}
A number of bizarre games of chance and skill are on display in the gaming pit. The one that seems to be attracting the most attention is Competitive Party Trebuchet, in which lordlings take turns firing boggarts from small party trebuchets at floating ring targets covered in spikes. 

Loading the trebuchet with a boggart and setting the tension takes a bonus action; aiming and firing it takes an action. A trebuchet Captain may work alone, or they may have a dedicated Loader to assist. An optional third team member, the Floater, can either assist these actions or attempt to disrupt their opponents. 

Prestige:
- +1 if you play Competitive Party Trebuchet.
- +1 if one player is both Captain and Loader.
- +1 if you play without a Floater.
- +1 every time your boggart dies. 
- -1 every time the opposing team's boggart die.
- +5 if you win Competitive Party Trebuchet.


Rules:
- The game lasts 10 rounds.
- The Captain rolls for initiative.
- On the Captain's turn, the Loader uses a bonus action to load a boggart into the trebuchet and set the tension. The Captain then uses their action to make a ranged attack against the target using the trebuchet (50/150ft, 1 target, to hit + Captain's DEX modifier) against the target. On a hit, the boggart takes 1d4 + Loader's STR modifier piercing damage.
- Each boggart has 6 HP. After it is impaled on the target, it is teleported back to the side of the trebuchet. If it dies on the target, it is resurrected with full health.
- Only one standard boggart can be loaded into a standard party trebuchet at once.

Floater Rules:
- If a team includes a Floater, they roll their own initiative.
- The Floater uses their turn to assist their team or disrupt their opponents by any means necessary. Examples might be to shrink their opponent's target, inspire their Captain, incapacitate the opposing team's Loader, and so on.

{{< spoiler title="The Dance Floor" >}}

Minor Eladrin lordlings are dancing before an audience of mortal guests, stolen from their dreams and transported to the Feywild for the party. The Eladrin are organized into troupes of 3 dancers each and presenting routines designed to charm their human guests. The troupe that wins the adoration of the most mortals wins.

Prestige:

* +1 if you enter the dance-off.
* +1 if 2 dance instead of 3; +2 if 1 dances instead of 3.
* +5 if you win the dance-off.

Rules:

The dance-off consists of three rounds with each participant rolling performance checks, gaining +1 score for each success. The more impressive your performance, the harder your opponents will have to dance to impress.

1. Each team begins with a score of 0.
1. The team with the highest combined Charisma modifier goes first. Teams alternate dancers until every dancer has had a turn in the round.
1. On your turn, describe your dance moves using your action, bonus action, and skill checks as you wish.
1. At the end of your turn, make a Charisma (Performance) check (DC 15 + opposing team's score). On a success, your team's score goes up by 1. On a failure, it goes down by 1. Your score cannot be less than 0.
1. At the end of three rounds, the team with the highest score wins.
1. If teams are tied at the end of three rounds, a sudden death dance battle begins.

Sudden Death:

1. Follow the same rules as above for a 1-on-1 dance off.
1. The battle ends when one team has a higher score at the end of a round.
1. After 5 rounds, sudden death ends and both teams are declared the winner.

You gain +2 prestige if you win a sudden death dance battle.
