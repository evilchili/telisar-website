    name: "P. K. E. Meter"
    type: Wondrous Item
    rarity: Rare (requires attunement)
    description: |
        The P.K.E. Meter has 4 charges. As a bonus action you can expend one charge to activate the meter for one hour, during which time you have advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) checks concerning the undead, curses, and extra-planar entities and objects.

        Additionally, while activated the P.K.E. Meter's crystals will glow in the presence of the undead, cursed items, or things not native to the Material Plane to a radius of 120 ft. The following colors indicate the type of presence detected:

        **Red** Undead, particularly ghosts, spectres, wraiths, etc.

        **Green** Creatures and objects not native to the Material Plane

        **Blue** Cursed creatures and objects

        The closer the meter is to the source of the P.K.E. signature, the brighter its crystals will glow. The crystals will flash when they are within 10 ft. The glass orb contains glowing red, green and blue mist that swirl and coalesce towards the general direction of the source.

        The P.K.E. Meter regains 1d4 charges daily at dawn.

This small, hand-held device consists of a glass orb in a brass setting mounted upon the wood-and-leather handle of a wooden clockwork mechanism. Two ratcheting brass arms protrude from the top of the device to either side,  each with 5 corundum chips embedded in them. The arms will extend forward and their crystals flash as the meter moves closer to the source of a Psycho-Kinetic Energy signature.
