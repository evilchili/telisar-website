Inns and Taverns in Telisar are named after the Major Arcana of the Tarot, for no reason other than it amuses me. Some establishments' names
refer directly to figures from Telisaran myth and folklore, the context of which implies the Major Arcana connection. Listed locations are 
known to the players; undocumented locations they have not yet discovered.
