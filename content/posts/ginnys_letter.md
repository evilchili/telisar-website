Lord Blacktongue,

Regarding the debts of the Spectacular Spectacular, I can assure you Raffa speaks the truth when he
tells your man there is nothing else to give (I have tossed his tent myself). I fear your investment
in this band of miserable outcasts will come to little unless changes are made. Perhaps Mr. Smalls
might find a way to capitalize where Raffa cannot? Say the word and we will arrange for the position
of Ringmaster to be vacated.

Ginny


PS: The bearer of this missive has skills most applicable to your enterprise -- quick fingered, an
excellent cheat at cards and would excel at second-storey work. You will find him easily swayed to
service by means of threats visited upon me, for I have seen to it that he has become quite taken
with me. In truth he is a fool, and you can probably tell him whatever you like. Consider him a
gift, a sign of mine and Janey's continued commitment to you. Assign him whatever value you judge
fair and apply it against our debt.
