Zandilar danced summerwise
<br>To the dawnward side of twilight
<br>She twirled and skipped from frost to veld
<br>Until the snows were melt


Zandilar danced wintershins
<br>While the Weaver's daughters shone
<br>Her toes tripped 'pon the starlit snows
<br>Beneath Mab's very nose


Can you make it there by candlelight?
<br>Why yes, and back again
<br>The Freelings and the Fey all know
<br>By the season of Titania's mood you go
