When there is no time, Raven lives in the stars<br/>Raven listens to the Gods’ stories of Telisar<br/>Raven loves the stories, and watches the First People<br/>But Raven is young, and the young are capricious

Raven comes down from the stars<br/>What is this? Raven asks<br/>This is magic, answers Syf, I create it<br/>What is this? Raven asks<br/>This is love, answers Freya, I create it<br/>What is this? Raven asks<br/>This is justice, answers Woden, I create it<br/>I wish to make things also! declares Raven<br/>Foolish bird, says Mimir, what can you make?<br/>The gods laugh, and Raven flies away

Raven flies across the Sea Of Chaos, to Greipani<br/>Greipani sits, perched on her treasure box<br/>Atop a mountain of gold<br/>Her devils bringing endless tribute<br/>Hello, Green Sister! calls Raven<br/>Hello Anansus, for I know it is you, says Greipani<br/>You are very clever, answers Raven, but not so clever as me<br/>Foolish bird, says Greipani, there are none cleverer than me<br/>A contest, then! says Raven<br/>Very well, says Greipani, What is the game?<br/>The first to trick Angrochinach’s sapphire from her clutches<br/>  must surely be the most clever, says Raven

Angrochinach has a sapphire the size of a Roc’s egg<br/>She taunts her sisters with it and prizes it above all else<br/>Greipani most of all, who has no sapphires, only gold

Greipani laughs, I know just how to do it! and flies off<br/>But Raven does not follow, Raven has tricked Greipani<br/>Raven opens Greipani’s treasure box and steals Time

Raven returns to the gods<br/>This is Time, cackles Raven, I create it! Hah!<br/>Foolish bird, now stories will have an end, says Mimir<br/>The First People will to grow old and die, says Thorus<br/>For Time contains an ending to all things<br/>And Raven wept for his foolishness.
