As we have thus shown, a review of the literature reveals a consensus amongst credible sources that the Magon Resonance Theory -- that expression of Will on the physical planes, viz., those groups of phenomena reductively and extemporaneously collected by some under the generic term *magic*, can be said to operate at least in part via the intentional construction and release of sympathetic vibrations between otherwise discrete components of materia across the spectra of observable reality -- provides a working model of the investigation of directed magonic phenomena with in a single plane. But little work has been done to examine the question of how the experimental data from the emerging study of Intra-Planar Dynamics might be resolved with the Magon Resonance Theory. This paper describes a new approach to intra-planar frequency modelling that includes and resolves inter-planar magonic resonance, and shows how experimental application of this approach correctly predicts the existe...

...compression wave in the positive dimension. Thus where intra-planar coherence *c* is <= 0.3z, a sympathy stabilized across two or more axes for a period satisfying f(*p*) = t/c^2k-1, where k > 0 will cause compression on the remaining axes as *c* approaches 0.

The implications of this model should be immediately obvious: magons that resist stabilization and are ejected as radicals will tend to resonate in localized sympathies that over time will coalesce into physical phenomena, a sort of residual accretion of magonic crystalline structures. Moreover, sustained periods of high-energy exchanges in a localized field will accelerate mass magonic ejection, creating a resonance loop that will resu...
