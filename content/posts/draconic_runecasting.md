The Dragonborn of Telisar had a highly advanced magical tradition millenia before others.
Runecasting consists of the arrangement of individual runes into complex forms that focus 
and channel raw magical energies into coherent spells. By careful study or reckless experimentation,
sorcerers of draconic descent can unlock this tradition and turn it to their use.

*Note: Casting this spell requires access to the physical Book Of Draconic Rune Forms, an enduring spellbook that records the individual runes.*

{{< spell >}}

When you cast this spell, you inscribe a glyph composed of Draconic Rune Forms that later unleashes a magical effect. You inscribe it either on a surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest) to conceal the glyph. The glyph can cover an area no larger than 3 feet square.

The glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against a DC of 17 to be found in full light, to a DC of 25 to be found in total darkness.

On your turn you must draw the rune correctly without consulting the physical Book and show it to the DM, who will determine whether you have composed the rune correctly. Each rune must include a Focus Form, a Target Form and an Effect Form as described in the physical Book. If your glyph includes the Form Of Target One, you must specify the target of the spell when you inscribe the glyph.

**Failing to Compose The Rune Forms** If the DM determines that you have not correctly drawn the glyph, the glyph immediately erupts in an explosion of magical energy. All creatures in a sphere of 15ft radius must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 4d6 force damage and is pushed back 10 feet on a failed save, or half as much, and is not moved, on a successful one. The surface you were inscribing becomes permanently scorched and cannot be inscribed with another glyph.

Any movement within 5 feet of the glyph will trigger the spell (if the movement is yours, you can choose to trigger the spell or not). This includes movement from visible creatures moving nearby as well as visible inanimate objects such as arrows, thrown items, moving the item on which the glyph is inscribed, and so on. Light level in the area has no impact on the trigger. When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a sphere centered on the glyph; the sphere has a radius of between and 5 and 15 feet, depending on the size of your glyph (glyph size in feet times five). The sphere spreads around corners.

The effect of a triggered spell depends on the rune forms used:

**Form of Destruction, Form of Target One** If your target is in range, they must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 damage on a failed saving throw or half as much damage on a successful one. For each additional level above 2nd, add an additional 1d8 damage (or half as much on saves).

**Form of Destruction, Form of Target Many**  Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d8 damage on a failed saving throw or half as much damage on a successful one. For each additional level above 1st, add an additional 1d8 damage (or half as much on saves).

**Form of Protection, Form of Target One**  If your target creature is in range and willing, they gain the positive effect of the spell for one minute. There is no effect for additional spell levels.

**Form of Protection, Form of Target Many**  Two willing creatures in the area gain the positive effect of the spell for one minute. For each additional spell level above 1st, two additional willing creatures in the area can be targeted. You choose the targets of the spell.

**Form of Nullification, Form of Target One** If your target is in range, they must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, all magical effects on the target which match the rune's effect form are dispelled for 10 minutes. The nullification applies to all spell and potion effects on the target, as well as any enchanted items they have. Concentration spells affecting the target are immediately ended.

**Form of Nullification, Form of Target Many**  The two creatures in the area closest to the glyph must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, all magical effects on the targets which match the rune's effect form are dispelled for 10 minutes. The nullification applies to all spell and potion effects on the targets, as well as any enchanted items they have. Concentration spells affecting the targets are immediately ended. For each spell level above 1st, two additional creatures in the area are targeted.

**Charging Glyphs** Glyphs successfully inscribed are charged at 1st level. You can increase the spell level by spending 2 sorcery points to increase the level by 1, to a maximum of your current spellcasting level. Once a glyph's spell is triggered, the magical effect is expended and the glyph becomes inert. Inert glyphs can be recharged as a bonus action, using 2 sorcery points per spell level.

**Destroying Glyphs** Once inscribed, a glyph remains intact until its form is disturbed (shattering the wood it's etched into, covering a painted glyph with new paint, stepping on a rune drawn in dirt, etc). You (and only you) can choose to destroy a charged glyph without triggering the spell effect in this way.
