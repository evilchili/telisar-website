Fey Giants vary widely in appearance and characteristics, but are generally  huge, standing over 15ft, monstrously strong, naturally resistant to all forms of magic, and outright immune to transmutation spells. They also tend to be dim-witted and easily fooled, making them the frequent targets of jest and trickery in the Fey courts, but are formidable opponents when enraged, so all but the most capricious of fey accord them a formal respect -- and a wide berth.

Peaseblossom is 16ft tall, with the head of a bear, the torso of a humanoid and goat legs ending in thick, stone-like hooves. His hide is covered in short, bristly brown fur. He drags behind him a three-bladed stone axe, seven feet long from pommel to tip.

**Magical Resistance** Fey Giants are resistant to all damage from spell effects.

**Transmutation Immunity** Fey Giants are immune to all magical effects from the school of transmutation. If targeted with a transmutation spell, Peaseblossom will make his next attack recklessly against what he believes is the source of the spell.


## Actions

**Multiattack** The giant makes two greataxe or swat attacks.

**Greataxe** *Melee Weapon Attack* +9 to hit on targets large and higher, +6 on targets medium and smaller, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 25 (3d12 + 6) slashing damage.

**Swat** *Unarmed Attack* +6 on targets medium and smaller, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit:  14 (2d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage. Targets must make a DC 16 STR saving throw or be pushed back 10 feet and knocked prone.

**Rock** *Ranged Weapon Attack* +9 to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. Hit: 28 (4d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage.
