Thorus once gave Anansus a spinning top with five sides; on each was depicted a face of one of the
Five - Thorus, Wodan, Syf, Mimir and Freya. "Here you go, little bird," he said, "see if you can
predict which of us will greet you when the top stops spinning."

Anansus spun the top. He watched it spin, and Thorus watched him watch it. The top spun, and spun,
and spun. A wide grin spread across the face of the young trickster god. Still the top spun, showing
no sign of stopping.

At last Thorus could not contain his irritation. "Anansus! Cease this foolishness and allow the top
to stop! That is the point of the game!"

But Anansus only grinned the wider, saying, "but choosing a side would ruin the game entirely."
