The party continued their deliberations, debating ways to release Magnus from his servitude to the
El Astrum Public Library in general and the necromancer Banu in particular, without surrendering the
residium.

Ara called on the power of his ancestral guardian, Aleh Xa Akiir, to send messages to anyone the
party thought might have advice or aid. First he tried Anthol Antholson, but was rebuffed. Next he
contacted Masym, Holy Mother of the Whitebridge Temple of Freya, who responded; unfortunately her
only advice was that the terms of a geas willingly entered into can only be broken according to the
terms of the agreement itself, or through divine intervention. Ara called on his patron god
Rillifane, but received no response.

Meanwhile, Magnus learned from Skaggit, the last remaining member of the Black Tack Goblin Tribe's
druidic Triumverate, that harvesting and processing residium is a gruelling process, and the only
way the goblins were able to do it was using alchemical equipment, several phials of reagents and
mythril tools, all of which were stolen from Drow somewhere deeper in the Underdark.  Magnus began
trying to chip away chunks of solid crystal using a a solid mythril pickaxe, to no avail.

It was then that four goblins materialized in the ceremonial chamber in front of the party, dragging
with them an elf, paralyzed and wrapped in his own travelling cloak. The goblins were quickly
dispatched, but not before Ara recognized the largest one as one that had ambushed each of the party
so many months ago, injecting them with residium serum and triggering all the events that followed.

Yuna cured the prisoner of his paralysis. He named himself as Elstuviar am Vakarilithien ("my
friends call me Stu"), alchemist and Herald of the Whisper King. This meant nothing to the party,
though Ara did recall one resident of Whitebridge mentioning the Whisper King in passing.

Stu had little to say about the Whisper King, except that it was an entity of great power that sent
him on quests to keep the world safe from dangers like residium. And indeed, Stu seemed to know a
great deal about residium, and immediately began inspecting the huge crystalline deposit. With
application of a combination of alchemical reagents pulled from somewhere under his cloak he
desolved a small portion of the crystal into a thick, viscous goop, which he stoppered in a small
vial and tucked away.

Magnus attacked Stu in an attempt to secure the vial, but was paralyzed by fumes from a shattered
vial thrown at him by the alchemist. Stu explained that he had the means to safely dispose of the
residium, and demonstrated by mixing the viscous goop with a second reagent which caused it to
sublimate into gas and disperse, leaving nothing behind. Stu announced he would remain here to
dispose of the entire residium deposit, but that it would take perhaps a year to complete.

Levani, having been betrayed by mysterious strangers offering help in the past, declared she didn't
trust the elf, and openly wondered whether the strange man was simply insane, arcane knowledge
notwithstanding.

In the end, they realized that even if Stu could safely rid them of the residium, it would do
nothing to help free Magnus from his servitude to Banu. Reluctantly, and with Yuna's warning that
resurrection was not without dangerous consequences fresh in his mind, Magnus agreed to die.

Keen drew his blade across Magnus's throat, and as soon as life had left him, Yuna cast the Revivify
spell, resurrecting him. But the totality of the experience and its effect on Magnus remains
to be seen.
