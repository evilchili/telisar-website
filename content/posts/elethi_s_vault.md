The circular lift ends its descent at a small landing before an archway of stone leading to a low-ceilinged room about 60 feet across: Madame Elethi's Vault. Bolted to the stone of the archway is a plaque, with a curious inscription and an oddly-shaped lightning bolt inscribed with small circles.

The floor of the room is covered in grid of stone tiles, each 5 feet square. Embedded into each stone is a brass letter or number in the Dwarven alphabet. You stand at the bottom of the grid. Beyond the stone tiles is another small archway similar to the one you find yourself in.
