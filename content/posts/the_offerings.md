Arranged in a half-circle before you are five stone bowls each 2ft in diameter and 6 inches deep and resting upon a low stone plinth. Into the stone of each plinth is carved the names of five prominent Dragonborn dieties in Draconic. From left to right, they read:

- Mim-ra-Teloc
- Frei-ya-Narlotec
- Wod-em-Coatlec
- Toru-sa-Matec
- Syf-ur-Potec

The first three bowls are empty. In the forth bowl rests the small skeleton of a bird, glowing with a faint blue luminescence. In the fifth rests a dried twig of holly, its leaves brown and cracked.

Behind these bowls rises the stone cliff. At its base a deep alcove perhaps 15 feet high and 5 feet wide has been carved. Its interior is obscured by darkness.
