*When we started the Frog Hat Club, we only ever envisioned a single adventure. About that...*

### [The Frog Hat Club]({{< ref "/tags/sessions" >}})
<small><b>[evilchili]</b></small> A motley crew of strangers are brought together by a mysterious, unknown force and bound to each other by magic ritual. The sky is torn open and Bahamut, the Goddess of Creation, is slain...

### [Castle Mystery]({{< ref "castle_mystery" >}})
<small><b>[carameldropz]</b></small> Residents of the sleepy town of Galehaven have gone missing. Rumours whisper of an evil power rising in an abandoned castle outside of town, and a reward for the safe return of the missing has been posted. But is there anyone brave enough to take up the search?
