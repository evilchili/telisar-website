**Shapechanger** If Madame Elethi isn't in running water, she can use her action to polymorph into a
Tiny bat or a Medium cloud of mist, or back into her true form. Madame Elethi's equipment is
absorbed into its body when it changes form.

While in bat form, Madame Elethi can't speak, her walking speed is 5 feet, has a flying speed
of 30 feet. Her statistics, other than its size and speed, are unchanged.

While in mist form, Madame Elethi can't take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. It is
weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature's space and
stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, and
it can't pass through water. It has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving
throws, and it is immune to all nonmagical damage.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day)** If Madame Elethi fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.

**Misty Escape** When she drops to 0 hit points outside its resting place, Madame Elethi transforms into a cloud of mist (as in the Shapechanger trait) instead of falling unconscious, provided that she isn't in running water. If she can't transform, it is destroyed.

While she has 0 hit points in mist form, she can't revert to her vampire form, and she must reach her resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed. Once in her resting place, she reverts to her vampire form. She is then paralyzed until she regains at least 1 hit point. After spending 1 hour in her resting place with 0 hit points, she regains 1 hit point.

**Spider Climb** Madame Elethi can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

**Enthralling Presence** Madame Elethi targets one humanoid she can see within 30 ft. of it. If the target can see Madame Elethi, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by Madame Elethi. The charmed target regards Madame Elethi as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn't under Madame Elethi's control, it takes Madame Elethi's requests or actions in the most favorable way it can, and it is a willing target for Madame Elethi's bite attack.

The effect lasts 24 hours or until Madame Elethi is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, takes a bonus action to end the effect, or is dispelled by magical means.

**Vampire Weaknesses** Madame Elethi has the following flaws:

Forbiddance. Madame Elethi can't enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants.

Harmed by Running Water. Madame Elethi takes 20 acid damage if it ends its turn in running water.

Sunlight Sensitivity. Madame Elethi cannot recover HP while in direct sunlight, including from Bites.

**Stake to the Heart** If a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into Madame Elethi's heart while Madame Elethi is incapacitated in its resting place, Madame Elethi is destroyed.

**Spellcasting** Madame Elethi is a 9th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 16, +8 to hit with spell attacks). Madame Elethi has the following wizard spells prepared:

Cantrips (at will): mage hand, prestidigitation, ray of frost
1st level (4 slots): comprehend languages, fog cloud, sleep
2nd level (3 slots): detect thoughts, gust of wind, mirror image
3rd level (3 slots): animate dead, bestow curse, nondetection
4th level (3 slots): blight, greater invisibility
5th level (1 slot): dominate person


## Actions

**Multiattack (Vampire Form Only)** Madame Elethi makes two attacks, only one of which can be a bite attack.

**Unarmed Strike (Vampire Form Only)** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage. Instead of dealing damage, Madame Elethi can grapple the target (escape DC 18).

**Bite (Bat or Vampire Form Only)** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is grappled by Madame Elethi, incapacitated, or restrained. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and Madame Elethi regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. A humanoid slain in this way and then buried in the ground rises the following night as a vampire spawn under Madame Elethi's control.

Madame Elethi can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creatureâ€™s turn. Madame Elethi regains spent legendary actions at the start of her turn.

**Unarmed Strike** Madame Elethi makes one unarmed strike.

**Bite (Costs 2 Actions)** Madame Elethi makes one bite attack.

The called creatures arrive in 1d4 rounds, acting as allies of Madame Elethi and obeying its spoken commands. The beasts remain for 1 hour, until Madame Elethi dies, or until Madame Elethi dismisses them as a bonus action.

## Lair and Lair Actions

**Monster Hunter's Curse** If Madame Elethi is destroyed in her lair by a humanoid, roll a 1d6. On a 1,2, 3, or 4 the humanoid is cursed, and suffers the effects specified below:

1-2: Unholy Compulsion: The humanoid suffers disturbing hallucinations after the sun sets, and is compelled to sleep in Madame Elethi's resting place. Each time they attempt a long rest not in Madame Elethi's resting place, make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the effects of the long rest are negated and the humanoid suffers 1 point of exhaustion. 

3-4: Restless Shadow: The humanoid's shadow begins to move on its own, its form not following the humanoid's movements. The next time the humanoid sleeps, the shadow disconnects from the body and becomes a a Shadow creature.

5-6: No effect.
